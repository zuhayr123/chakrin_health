    <string name="glutes_text">The butt consists of three main muscles: the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. They work together to help us move our legs in all directions. Because they\'re connected to the hips, the lower back, and the legs, strengthening the glutes can help to stabilize the back.</string>
    <string name="full_body_workout">A full body workout is just what it sounds like: a workout that aims to hit all the major muscle groups in one single session. Popular programs would include exercises for back, legs, chest, shoulders, arms and core. There are many reasons some trainees like to utilise a full body workout, whether from time to time or as a standard go-to in their workout routine. “When performing full-body workouts, you don’t want to waste time doing isolation exercises,” says personal trainer Matt Hampton. “You want to get the biggest, hardest exercises done for the biggest muscle stimulation.” There are countless variations and ways to structure full body workouts but they all have this above idea in common.</string>
    <string name="upper_body_work">The pull up is a classic exercise and one that is used to target the muscles of the upper back. The movement accomplishes the vertical pull movement pattern. The pull up is thought to be one of the best back exercises for lats. However, not a lot of people can perform them. The workout progressions at the bottom of this article will show you how you can train from a beginner stage to being able to perform an unassisted bodyweight pull up in the advanced stage.</string>
    <string name="cardio">Aerobic exercise (also known as cardio or cardio-respiratory exercise) is physical exercise[1] of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process.[2] Aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism.[4] Aerobic exercise is performed by repeating sequences of light-to-moderate intensity activities for extended periods of time.</string>
